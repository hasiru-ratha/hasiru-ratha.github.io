We need dedicated, passionate folks to help in our mission to greenify Bengaluru. If you live around Basavanagudi, Jayanagar, Gandhi Bazar join us every morning between 6am and 8am. Generally Hasiru Ratha keeps moving from one location to another. Nagaraj sir and a few senior members decide where which part we will be in. We have a whatssap goroup where the location is put out and we gather around there start our work.
