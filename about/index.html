<p><img src="/img/about/HR12.jpeg" alt="Hasiru-Ratha" style="height:200px; float:right"/>
Hasiru Ratha literally means &ldquo;Green Chariot&rdquo; in Kannada, that is the name we use
to refer the Maruti Suzuki Eeco Van which we use during our activities. It is
generally adapted according the purpose of that mornings activities. In summer
it is filled with water drums, mesh, supports for the plants. During the rainy
season, it is generally filled with manure, pick axes and samplings to be
planted.</p>

<p>Hasiru Ratha is also the name for our organizationR. Manya Nagaraj started Hasiru
Ratha first a way of saving the saplings planted by the BBMP, but could not be
cared for by them. He started initally watering the plants around the area, where he lives
near Yediyur circle and later on he purchased the van with his own money.</p>

<h2 id="the-group">The Group</h2>

<p><img src="/img/about/HR13.jpeg" alt="Hasiru-Ratha" style="height:200px; float:right"/>
Manya Nagaraj has since inspired many people to join him in his endevours to
save the plants and Hasiru Ratha has grown with more and more people taking
interest in its activities. We are currently about 20 active members from
different age groups and proffessions. We generally work in groups of 3 to 4 to
attend to everything that the saplings need</p>

<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>

<p><img src="/img/about/Group.jpeg" alt="Hasiru-Ratha" style="height:200px; float:right"/>
Generally, Hasiru Ratha&rsquo;s activities are about maintenance of saplings. We have
found that just planting a sapling gives it very less chances of growing into a
tree, so Hasiru Rathas focus is doing all the nessecary things to take care of
saplings till they can sustain on thier own.</p>

<p>Let us say a 3 foot sapling has
been planted, we put a mesh gaurd around the sapling to prevent stray cattle
from eating it, we water it regularly, provide manure and a support to ensure it
grows straight. We continue to water it until the sapling reaches about 8 feet
to 10 feet in height.</p>

<p>After this sapling has grown to about 5 to 6 feet in height, we generally trim
the branches, shoots between the ground level and 3 feet so that the sapling
continues to grow taller. We remove the mesh-gaurd to reused for another
sapling. We provide a taller support so that it continues to grow straight.</p>

<p><img src="/img/about/SupportHeight.jpeg" alt="Hasiru-Ratha" style="height:200px; float:right"/>
The duration of this process would be about 6 months to 2 years, depending on
the type of sapling. During this
period Hasiru Ratha members generally keep out a vigil for the plants so that
they aren&rsquo;t damaged by people trying to park thier cars, or vendors using the
plants a way to display thier wares.</p>
